Announcing a blog post series on the coreBOS workflow system.

===

We have been enhancing the coreBOS workflow system since the project started, converting it into a very powerful BPM tool.

With this post I am starting a series to explain some of the possibilities and convey to the readers how to implement business automation processes with it.

I will start explaining the general functionality and underlying philosophy and then be posting once a month talking about the different tasks each month.

As a side effect of this blog post series i expect to create documentation in the wiki and, most probably, some video tutorials

During these posts we will talk a lot about the workflow expression language which is used everywhere in the application and I will start a tweet campaign where i will tweet regularly about each of the workflow expression functions, so remember to subscribe to our Twitter channel, our YouTube channel and this blog site to stay informed.

Stay tuned!
