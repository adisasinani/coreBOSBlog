**Wow! Almost a month since my last post!**

Frenetic, exciting, busy are just some of the adjectives I could use to describe the last few weeks. The flow of ideas, projects and enhancements that have started to erupt is incredible, we were really blocked by vtiger culture, and it feels **wonderful to be free!**

In these past weeks we have dedicated time to the **REST interface of coreBOS** with many enhancements that open the possibilities of integration tenfold, the [coreBOS Webservice development platform](https://github.com/tsolucio/coreBOSwsDevelopment) has seen a whole bunch of unit tests to validate the REST enhancements and the [coreBOS Webservice Library](https://github.com/tsolucio/coreBOSwsLibrary) has seen an update of it's PHP and Javascript versions to make them smaller, faster and more useful.

coreBOS itself has seen a whole bunch of **bug fixes** and **enhancements**. Among the most important is **support for PHP 5.4 and 5.5** and a whole set of external library updates and **warning message eliminations**, but we haven't stopped there, at all, there are a **full range of projects that have started** and that will be arriving soon after our next release, so keep tuned, this is getting very interesting :-)
