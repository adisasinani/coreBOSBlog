When I started my blogging career, one of the first things I did was migrate the existing posts, so I read them all again. When I read the first [coreBOS is born post](../corebos-is-born) I asked myself; would I do it again? How do I feel about it now? And a few other similar questions. So I decided then that I would dedicate a post to answering these questions publically.

Happy reading, I hope it is as controversial as I intend.

===

## Would I fork vtiger CRM again?

**Hell yes!!** The only thing I regret is not doing it sooner.

## How do I feel about having forked vtiger CRM now?

**Incredible!**

I see what coreBOS has become, all the things that are happening and what is coming and I feel alive, proactive, in control and helping our community and our users.

## Why would I fork vtiger CRM?

The list of reasons is long, among the most important that come to mind you can find

### freedom

To be able to take the project where it needs to go. Vtiger is a private/closed source company that does not collaborate with its implementors. It only attends the needs of their ondemand product, so **as an open source consultant and implementor I cannot service my clients with their product**.

### help our users

With vtiger we had our hands tied. We had to fix their bugs and then they would release a new version changing everything, with no notification nor collaboration, no sharing. We would have to start again fixing the same bugs and others. Now we fix something and it stays fixed. We don't have to explain that we need more time and money to do things that have already been done. Now we take our clients forward, evolving their software to their needs while giving functionality to all the others. **It's constructive.** Constructive for the application, constructive for our development efforts and investments and constructive for our relationship with our users and community.

### stop doing the same things over and over again

The politics in Vtiger company is to **release buggy untested software from time to time**. It is mostly buggy because it isn't being used, what they release is just a surgical copy-paste of some parts of their closed project, and there is no community participation so you end up creating bug fixes and extensions that you have to create again version after version while they go forward on a stable private version. What is even worse from a business perspective is that you have to learn all the new junk they release investing in time and money you pay your programming resources. Money that must come from your clients. 

### community

The existing community is a bunch of leaches or vultures that are not doing their clients any favor. Their clients look at them for guidance as the professional consultants that they are and they put them on an insecure futureless software program, then they spend months criticizing the situation just to do it all over again, year after year. As an anecdote (which I share a lot) I still remember my first contribution to a real open source project, I had just created coreBOS and made a translation for RespondCMS, a few hours later it was accepted and I got a big thank you. It was **an incredible experience** that I didn't know existed after being ignored for so long on vtiger CRM. I mean they didn't even incorporate my translation files after so much support that I gave them. There is no open source vtiger CRM project and there is no community. I may be biased or completely wrong on a lot of things I am saying in this post, but don't let anyone trick you into believing that what I just said is false. **This one is true.**

### they deserve it

Their open source project is a fallacy, they treat their languishing community with disrespect and sincerely I don't understand (I never have) why they even bother: they have **a good business with their on demand** (the only thing they are concerned about), they dedicate programming resources to it and it has a lot of functionality and very good features (at least that is what I have heard), it has its market segment, so why bother dedicating a bunch of time and effort every 18 months or so to releasing an incomplete and untested community version which is useless. Just forget about it, keep going with your closed version.

My best quest is that they use the experience to train new programmers who study the ondemand version while they get some marketing noise. Even if they talk bad about you, it is still talk.

**They don't have an open source community, they don't have an open source company, they don't have an open source mindset, they don't deserve to have an open source project**

## Closing notes

Whether you are an implementor using vtiger CRM for your clients  or the person responsible of the open source vtiger CRM install in your company, I recommend that you stop using their open source version. You can stay with the on demand version if you want and it covers your needs.
