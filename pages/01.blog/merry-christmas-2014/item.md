### Merry Christmas and Happy New Year

What a year! Saying it was a roller coaster ride would be a total shortcoming!!

This year has seen the birth of **coreBOS**. It has been extremely convulsive in the mother company with constant changes, ups and downs, doubts and risks. I have to say that, all in all, I couldn't be happier. Specially seeing what coreBOS has become already and knowing what it will become in the near future. Confident that this decision has made us stronger, more in control of a true open source project.

I look forward to all the projects we have for 2015, some will be spectacular, others won't quite make it, but we will be here helping you make the best of **coreBOS to accomplish your goals**.

Thank you for following and supporting coreBOS

**<u>Merry Christmas and a really Fantastic and Happy New Year.</u>**

Regards,

**The coreBOS Team.**
