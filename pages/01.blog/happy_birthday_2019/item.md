Another year just flew by. It has been an interesting year in the life of coreBOS, a lot of functionality and changes, and a considerable amount of blog posts!

**<span style="font-size:large;color:red;">Happy Birthday coreBOS!!</span>**

===

## coreBOS is five years old!

Last year I started a blog post series talking about existing and/or new functionality in coreBOS while maintaining the regular monthly blog post about the changes going on each month. Additionally to these posts we got a few special posts and some very interesting guests posts also.

My plan for this next year is to continue with the same format. I think it is useful to show the features and how we use them and the constant flow of changes makes it easy to see that the project is very much alive and active. Besides the effort to create those two blog posts is just about as much as I can fit into my agenda.

So, in the months ahead I am going to release **two regular posts a month**. One, _on the first week of the month_, which will be a series covering usage, functionality and configuration topics. The other will be _on the third week of the month_ and will continue the same process I have been using to explain the most important things that happened to the coreBOS application _the previous month_, so we will keep getting a constant flow of things that are happening.

Like last year, I have a list of things to talk about but I am totally open to suggestions, so if there is anything you would like to read about, don't hesitate to reach out to me and I will try to organize.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Thank you for being part of the coreBOS project. I wish you a wonderful year.

 !!! **<span style="font-size:large">Happy Birthday from the whole coreBOS Team</span>**
