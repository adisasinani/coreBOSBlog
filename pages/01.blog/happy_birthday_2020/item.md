Another year of this incredible adventure. Sadly, these are not times for celebration. The global COVID-19 pandemic joined with our very high level of selfishness will make the months ahead very complicated for many. It is time to join forces and look beyond our personal needs to overcome the challenge that nature has brought us. Please take care of yourselves!

 !! **NOTE: ** I will try to keep the regular coreBOS blog posts frequency and normality, just so you have a small reason to get the worries off your mind :-)

## coreBOS is six years old!

I had a quick look at this past year's posts and commits and it is astonishing:

- Workflows get a whole bunch of changes and new functionality: context, robustness, web service calls, relate/unrelate, ...
- Process Flow
- Spreadsheet
- Record Version
- Mattermost
- Business Questions !!
- Map Editors
- GenDoc web service and enhancements
- Decision Table
- Price Modification
- Sendgrid
- SMTP per user
- Developer Blocks
- Partial Sales Order to Invoice conversion control
- Hooks for inventory product lines
- Upsert web service

Just to name a few that caught my attention.

Similar to the previous year I kept working on the blog post series talking about existing and/or new functionality in coreBOS while maintaining the regular monthly blog post about the changes going on each month. Additionally to these posts we got a few special posts and some very interesting guest posts also.

My plan for this next year is to continue with the same format. I think it is useful to show the features and how we use them and the constant flow of changes makes it easy to see that the project is very much alive and active. Besides the effort to create those two blog posts is just about as much as I can fit into my agenda.

So, in the months ahead I am going to release two regular posts a month. One, on the first week of the month, which will be a series covering usage, functionality and configuration topics. The other will be on the third week of the month and will continue the same process I have been using to explain the most important things that happened to the coreBOS application the previous month, so we will keep getting a constant flow of things that are happening.

As usual, I have a list of things to talk about but I am totally open to suggestions, so if there is anything you would like to read about, don't hesitate to reach out to me and I will try to organize.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Thank you for being part of the coreBOS project. I wish you a wonderful year.
