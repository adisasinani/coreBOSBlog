Another month packed with features and developer enhancements among which the start of the new LDS design, easier docker support, and the incredible Decision Table are significant examples. Enjoy!

===

 ! coreBOS UI
As we have said in the past, we are (slowly) moving the UI to [LDS standards](https://www.lightningdesignsystem.com/). Inside this projects' effort [Fatjola](https://github.com/fatjola) and [Luke](https://gist.github.com/Luke1982) do a great job of redesigning the header which we incorporate into the mainstream application. Thanks!

 - move Announcement marquee to the button bar in order to optimize space
 - move subheader into the header to recover vertical space
 - move small spinner to the right so it is more visible in the new layout
 - move 'top' below menu so it still works (more or less) after the fixed menu change
 - show settings menu only to admin users and set the user name to bold
 - user settings label for settings button and menu
 - apply some LDS to the toolbar just to get announcement correct
 - eliminate Calculator from application
 - apply column layout for **Integrations** access menu and box the elements to make them stand out more
 - module icon definition: now each module has some icon properties that are used in the header and "last viewed" section among others
 - add a **getModuleIcon** information function in utils

 ! Mobile 

The mobile client gets some fixes and enhancements this month. Thanks [Omar](https://github.com/omarllorens)

- add new mobile UI action ExecuteFunctions to call it from javascript. We add some functions from coreBOS base functionality
- add support to uitype 50: date time field
- now when you select a product or service in the time control module, we hide the unnecessary fields for each type
- fix error in name to units in time control
- Fields with uiytpe (10, 101, 117, 26, 357, 51, 52, 53, 57, 66, 68, 73, 76, 77, 78, 80) were always shown even if deactivated in the profile
- filter fields with no permission when creating
- Fix detectModuleName, we have to get always the module name if we have a recordid, if not we can have problems on related lists with more than one module related
- inputs id must be with internal field name not translated label
- do not show empty blocks on edit view
- PHP 7.3 support by specific assignment and use the correct object for translation

<span></span>

 ! Features/Implementor

 - support for **currentuserID** meta variable in **Condition Expression Business Map**

  - Code formatting
 - add support for **CC** condition in [Mail Converter](http://corebos.com/documentation/doku.php?id=en:adminmanual:mailconverter&noprocess=1)
 - we release our coreBOSCRM SendGrid integration. I will try to blog about how it works soon but you can look up v√≠deos in our [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqH0YuMrOI9HSEObq3xqXLQ) to start
 - define default module sort order using global variables **Application_ListView_Default_OrderField** and **Application_ListView_Default_OrderDirection**
 - [Show Message Widget](http://corebos.com/documentation/doku.php?noprocess=1&id=en:devel:add_special_block#another_exampleshow_message)

 - **Application_Popup_Address_Selection** Global Variable that permits us to deactivate the Account/Contact address selection on capture
 - [add customizeable restraints to Product/Service Inventory autocomplete](https://gist.github.com/Luke1982/d886a67eb661db777d93e7e645076ecc) Spectacular and useful enhancement [from Luke!](https://gist.github.com/Luke1982)

 ! Developer

  - permit configuring where to save user privileges using the **cbodUserPrivilegesStorage** variable
 - deactivate activity reminder variable to make debug log less noisy: **ActivityReminder_Deactivated**. Currently it is only in the browser, we need to add a global variable in the application to deactivate it permanentely
 - implement **fetch based** call in ExecuteFunctions, which turns out to be identical in speed to the one we have so I leave it commented for future reference
 - QueryGenerator range operators where operator can be '[]', '[[', ']]', ']['
```
QueryGenerator->addConditions(column, '[]', array(initial,end));
```
