Here we are again, another year in the life of coreBOS. Last year I set out to give coreBOS a regular blog post on its history. That journey ends today with this post and a new set of goals are laid out for the year ahead.

## coreBOS is four years old!

Last year I started a blog post series on the monthly changes that coreBOS has gone through since we started. That series has been a year-long journey where we have not only visited the history but also validated and extended the functionality while creating a lot of documentation and video tutorials which was also one of the goals.

Now that we are up to date in the monthly changes and that series is over, I am going to set out on another journey and blog post series which, again, will serve the purpose of generating new content for the documentation site and promote coreBOS by explaining all the amazing things it can do.

In the months ahead I am going to release **two regular posts a month**. One, _on the first week of the month_, which will be a series covering usage, functionality and configuration topics. The other will be _on the third week of the month_ and will continue the same process I have been using to explain the most important things that happened to the coreBOS application _the previous month_, so we will keep getting a constant flow of things that are happening.

Over the past year, as I wrote the previous series, I created a list of topics that I thought needed more in-depth explanation. My initial plan was to create posts as I found them but I received pressure from the community because many people did not understand why I was writing about things that happened so long ago. So I decided to just finish and continue extending coreBOS knowledge in another format that, hopefully, will be more evident.

In any case, as the past year, I have a clearly defined plan of issues to write about. Some of these ideas are:

 - business maps
 - external applications and integrations
 - functionality and usage
 - webservice enhancements
 - eventing
 - workflow enhancements
 - implementor and developer tips and utilities

but I am totally open to suggestions, so if there is anything you would like to read about, don't hesitate to reach out to me and I will try to organize.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Thank you for being part of the coreBOS project. I wish you a wonderful year.
