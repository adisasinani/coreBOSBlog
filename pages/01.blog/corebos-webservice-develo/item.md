We are proud to present the **coreBOS webservice developers' tools** project!

This project is formed by two parts: the [coreBOS webservice library](https://github.com/tsolucio/coreBOSwsLibrary) and the [coreBOS webservice developers' tool](https://github.com/tsolucio/coreBOSwsBrowser).

The first is a set of high level methods to access and work with the **coreBOS web service RESTful interface**, while the second is an attractive development interface for testing, learning and working with the applications' REST interface.

The web service developer application is also the base upon which we **test the enhancements and features of the REST interface**, so you can easily load real examples that we have created to test the functionality and, ideally it will serve as a common ground to debug problems that anybody may encounter.

Both projects are very stable and won't be seeing full roadmaps and release schedules. Instead we will be applying **continuous integration and bug fixes** so I would recommend to follow the projects for change notifications.

The projects are **fully open source and available on GitHub**, so feel free to come on over and help out.
