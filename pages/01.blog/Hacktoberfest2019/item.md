Hacktoberfest 2019 starts this week!

===

As in the previous editions, I will try to work on projects different than coreBOS itself although always in some way related but I have [setup a list of coreBOS issues](https://github.com/tsolucio/corebos/labels/Hacktoberfest) that anyone can pick up to participate in the event. I invite you to have a look and reach out to me if you need help.

This is the list of things I would like to dedicate time to and hopefully my PRs will fall into one or more of these categories:

 - [Mattermost](https://mattermost.com/)
 - [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/)
 - Business Process Management mapping for coreBOS
 - [Docker configuration files](https://github.com/spikeassociates/DockerConfigs)
 - [LDS web components](https://github.com/spikeassociates/LDSWC/issues)
 - coreBOS Security:
   - setup regular scan of code with [sonarqube](https://sonarqube.org)
   - review and fix sonarqube warnings comments
 - [OrientDB](https://orientdb.com) and [ArangoDB](https://arangodb.com)

You can [register for the event here](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) and [follow your progress here](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/profile).

Happy Hacking!!
