### Create records while validating your webforms!!

Thanks to our team member [Bernat Arlandis](http://bernatarlandis.com/) we now have a really nice script to make **creating records** in our coreBOS system **from our web forms** on our web sites **a breeze**. We can even do the important **validating of duplicates** based on different fields just configuring some settings!

This project will even permit us to create more than one record which is a typical use case in many scenarios because somebody who has been spending some time on your website and bothers in asking you some questions is definitely not a lead but a **good business opportunity**.

[Read all about it on the **projects' wiki/documentation** page](http://corebos.org/documentation/doku.php?id=en:devel:coreboswswebform&noprocess).

[Get the code and test it out on github](https://github.com/tsolucio/coreBOSwsWebform)
